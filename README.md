> A Discord bot for LOL Server

This repository is containing discord bot for League Of Legend Server. So it might not work properly. I don't fix those issues because I made it for private purpose. Its code must be seemed to be dirty. If you don't want to read codes like these and you want to change it, issue or PR it.



## Requirements

.Net

Discord.Net



## Installation

First you download this, you need a discord bot token. Then, build this project and execute, and it will show you an error ã…¡ NO CONFIG AVAILABLE. And, go to executable folder, and there will be config.json file. Edit it properly and run this bot again. It will work!
